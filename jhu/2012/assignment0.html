<p>
  In this course, there will be four homework assignments (not
  counting this one).  These assignments will be automatically graded
  and their results will be uploaded to a leaderboard, which will show
  assignment-level and cumulative leaders for each assignment.
</p>

<p><b>Do this now</b></p>

<p>
In order to setup the homework environment, please do the following:
</p>

<ul class="real">
  <li class="real">Sign up
    for <a href="http://www.piazza.com/jhu/spring2012/en600468">our Piazza
      course</a>.
  <li class="real">Email <a href="http://cs.jhu.edu/~post/">Matt Post</a> with the following information:
    <ul class="real">
      <li class="real">Your name
      <li class="real">Your preferred email address
      <li class="real">A handle (this will identify you on the leader board)
      <li class="real">A base URL where we can download your
      assignments (see below)
    </ul>
  <li class="real">Upload your "assignment0.txt" file to your
  designated location.  This file should contain a single number.
</ul>

<p><b>Base URL</b></p>

<p>
The leaderboard will score and rank your assignments, both on a
per-assignment and cumulative basis.  In order to automate this
process, we need to know where to find your files.  Each assignment in
the course will be submitted by making available the output of your
  assignment at some set location.  This location will be:
</p>

<pre>
  BASE_URL/assignment0.txt
  BASE_URL/assignment1.txt
  BASE_URL/assignment2.txt
  BASE_URL/assignment3.txt
  BASE_URL/assignment4.txt
</pre>

<p>
If you have web space (say on the CS servers), your BASE_URL could be
there (e.g., <code>cs.jhu.edu/~post/mt-class</code>).  If you don't
have access, you can used a service
like <a href="http://db.tt/OH6VZxS">Dropbox</a>.  Dropbox, in
particular, allows you to create a folder in your Public folder and
then share the URL with us (it will look something
like <code>http://dl.dropbox.com/u/23493939/mt-class/assignment0.txt</code>).
</p>

<p>
If you have questions about this or problems producing a BASE_URL,
please post them to Piazza.
</p>

<p><b>Evaluations</b></p>

<p>Assignment 0 is evaluated according to an unknown metric.  Some
  numbers are better than others.<p>

<p>Assignment 0 does not count against your grade.</p>

<p><b>Leaderboards</b></p>

The leaderboards will be posted as soon as there is data.  The board
will work as follows: as soon as a homework is posted, we will look
for assignment solutions for every student every hour on the hour.
These files will be scored and used to update the leader board.  You
can change this file as often as you'd like; we will use the latest
results.  Your official project turn-in will be whatever we download
at project due time, which will typically be 11:59 PM EDT.
