<p><b>Level</b>: Senior undergraduate or first-year graduate.
<p><b>Course Catalog Description</b>: 
<a href="http://translate.google.com">Google translate</a> can instantly
translate between any pair of over fifty human languages (for instance, from
French to English). How does it do that? Why does it make the errors that it 
does? And how can you build something better? Modern translation systems 
like Google Translate and <a href="http://www.microsofttranslator.com/">Bing Translator</a>
<i>learn</i>
how to translate by reading millions of words of already translated text, 
and this course will show you how they work. The course covers a diverse set 
of fundamental building blocks from linguistics, machine learning, algorithms, 
data structures, and formal language theory, along with their application to
a real and difficult problem in artificial intelligence. 

<p><b>Textbook:</b>
Some readings will be drawn from <a href="http://www.statmt.org/book/">Statistical Machine Translation</a> (<a href="http://statmt.org/book/errata.html">errata</a>) 
by <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/pkoehn/">Philipp Koehn</a> 
You can read it online through the <a href="https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/catalog/bib_3522360">JHU library</a> or 
or purchase from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Statistical-Machine-Translation-Philipp-Koehn/dp/0521874157">Amazon</a>.
A more compact (but therefore less thorough) <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~alopez/papers/survey.pdf">survey</a> by 
<a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~alopez">Adam Lopez</a> is available for free. Note that the readings (and therefore the textbook) 
aren't strictly required; what's required is that you understand the concepts and are able to apply them.</p>


<p><b>Goals</b>:
By the end of the course, you should have a good grasp of what goes into
a building a large-scale natural language processing  system, and experience 
selecting and applying diverse techniques from computer science to solve
real-world problems.

<p><b>Requirements</b>:
You'll need strong programming skills for homeworks and a final project.
Natural language processing (<a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/465/">465</a>)
is recommended, but not required.


<a name="grading"></a><h2>Course Structure and Grading</h2>
<h3>Homework (4 assignments, 10 points apiece)</h3>
<p>Class meetings will consist mainly of lectures, but the only way to 
fully understand all of the problems that you need to solve in building a 
language processing system is to go out and build one. To that end, the course
will be evaluated on four <i>competitive</i> homework assignments and a final
project.</p>

<p>The goal of each homework assignment will be to build a system the solves 
a well-defined subproblem of machine translation. Students will earn a passing
grade (7 points) by correctly implementing a standard algorithm that we specify, 
and additional credit for building the best system according to an objective 
metric: 6 points for the best system, 5 points for the second best, and so on. 
To receive an A in the class, you must compete!
For each task we will provide a simple baseline, datasets, and metrics. The tasks 
are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="hw1.html"><b>Alignment</b>: given a set of translated documents that are aligned at the sentence level,
  identify the words that are translations of each other.</a></li>
<li><a href="hw2.html"><b>Decoding</b>: find the most probable translation of a sentence, given a 
  translation model and a new input sentence.</a></li>
<li><a href="hw3:html"><b>Evaluation</b>: design a metric of translation accuracy  that correlates 
  with human judgement.</li>
<li><a href="hw4.html"><b>Reranking</b>: find the most <i>accurate</i> translation of a sentence,
  given an input and a list of ranked alternative translations.</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>In-Class Presentation: Language in Ten Minutes (10 points)</h3>
<p>How are you going to build a machine translation system unless you know at
least a little bit about language? You will be required to give 
a short presentation (~10 minutes) on a particular language <i>that you do 
not speak natively</i>, e.g., Arabic, Chinese, Czech, Hindi, Italian, or Maltese.</p>

<p>You should prepare three to six slides for your presentation, covering
language facts (demographics, location, etc.) important linguistic 
characteristics (orthography, morphology, syntax) and computational efforts 
such as resources, tools, papers. For instance,  how many entries are there
about the language in the <a href="http://www.mt-archive.info">MT 
Archive?</a> and what are they generally about? Be creative and have fun. 
Asking for help from native speakers or language experts is great. But you are 
ultimately responsible for the presentation.</p>

<p>This assignment was inspired by <a href="http://www.nizarhabash.com/">Nizar Habash</a>. 
You might want to browse the 
<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/comse6998machinetranslation/language-in-10-minutes">examples
from his class</a>, and his list of recommended resources: 
<a href="http://www.ethnologue.com/">Ethnologue</a>, 
<a href="http://www.omniglot.com/">Omniglot</a>,
<a href="http://www.aboutworldlanguages.com/">About World Languages</a>, and the
<a href="http://www.mt-archive.info/">Machine Translation Archive</a>.</p>

<p>Presentations will be graded on thoroughness and clarity. What 
did you learn from your research that was really interesting? Tell us!</p> 

<a name="project"></a>
<h3>Final Projects (40 points)</h3>

<p>The final project will
be designed by the student or groups of students, with guidance from the 
instructors. As with the homework assignments, it should be on well-defined 
problem with clearly identified input, output, and evalution, and executed 
with creativity and depth.</p>

<p>Towards the middle of the term you will be required to turn in a brief
project proposal (10 points), laying out the problem, your proposed solution, and a
plan for implementation and evaluation. Your final project report (20 points) should explain 
your implementation, evaluation, and analysis, focusing on a single question:
What did you learn? The projects will be presented during an interactive poster
session during the final exam period (10 points).</p>

<p>The project proposal should be 1-2 pages (there is no hard limit, but it 
will take us longer to give you feedback if your proposal is long or 
unclear) and must clearly identify:</p>

<ul class="real">
<li>A single question or problem related to machine translation. This should be 
stated in the first paragraph. We strongly advise including some simple examples 
to illustrate the question or problem.</li>
<li>An outline of the work to be done: how will your project answer the question 
or attempt to solve the problem? What models and algorithms will you implement? 
What <a href="#software">software</a> will you use?</li>
<li>A description of planned experiments: how will you know if the question was 
answered or the problem was solved? You should clearly identify input, output, 
and evaluation strategy.</li>
</ul>

<p>The proposal is a contract. If we give you full credit for it, that means 
we expect you to implement it and do a good analysis of the results, and we 
will give you full credit for the entire project if you do. If you turn in a 
weak proposal, we will give you the opportunity to submit a revised one before 
moving forward, but the longer you take to define your project, the less time 
you will have to implement it, so it's in your best interest to take advantage 
of this early checkpoint.</p>

<p>Before the proposal is due, you should make an appointment with one of the 
instructors in order to discuss project ideas; this will enable you to submit 
a proposal with full confidence that it will be well-received. Before meeting 
with us, you might want to browse over topics that we'll be covering later in 
the term, since these might suggest ideas to you. We will however give you 
fairly wide latitude to choose a topic as long as it's related in some way to 
translation and is technically interesting, so you should not feel restricted to 
these topics. We can suggest topics to you in individual meetings if you're 
stumped, but it will help us to know what your interests and strengths are, so 
be prepared to tell us what you're curious about.</p>

<p>Groups projects of any size are permitted, but we will require an amount of 
work that is linear in group size, so you should take into account the overhead 
of group coordination when forming groups. Each group should turn in a single 
proposal identifying all members. All group members will receive the same grade, 
and you are stuck with your group members once your proposal is finalized: we 
refuse to adjudicate stories about who did or did not contribute. Choose your 
partners carefully.

<h3>Quizzes (10 points)</h3>

<p>These are mainly designed to help us understand how well you're following along.</p>
